# Odin Game1
Odin Game1 is a living game I am developing as I learn Odin.  It will no real purpose othan to provide me with a history of how I learn to program games in Odin.

# Why Odin?
I've been messing around with loads of game engines including GameMaker, Unity, Godot, Unreal... and never really found any of these stuck with me.

I thought I would try a different approach!
